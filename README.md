## intro
getting started
Hello there,🙋‍♀️ 

My name is **Sandra Atino** and i am 31 years old , originally from **Uganda** but i have lived in belgium close to 6years now. I am a graduate of radio and tv electronics although i have mainly worked in a graphic design field creating wedding cards and bussiness cards. Eversince moving to Belgium (wallonia) i kind of lost my way due to language difficulty but recently i got struck by luck when a friend send me a link about hack your future Belgium, this definitely grabbed my attention and so i took the challenge and the more assignements i did ..the more curious i got. Now i find myself with a more serious thirst to learn even more and better to be able to create projects. I am ready to learn from my mistakes.
